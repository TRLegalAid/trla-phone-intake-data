# trla-phone-intake-data
Web crawler written in Python using Selenium to get performance reports from RingCentral and add them to a Google Sheet for internal data tracking of TRLA phone calls.

The files in the ringcentral_api_code folder are attempts to use the ringCentral API to retrieve call data daily and recreate the performance repots, but it's not clear whether this will yield the exact same results, so the web crawler is being used for now.
